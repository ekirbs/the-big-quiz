# the-BIG-quiz

## Description

This is the BIG quiz!  Although it's not so BIG yet, it has room to grow.  I made this quiz to gain a better undertsanding of JavaScript commands, mostly how to utilize a timing function and storing and retrieving data from localstorage.  The questions have no real theme other than things I am interested in outside of coding.  It's not meant to be serious questions, they are more for fun.  But give it a go!

GOOD LUCK ON THE QUIZ!!

## Usage

Once the Start Button is pressed, the user will have 100 seconds to answer all the questions.  A correct answer will move them to the next question with no penalty, but if the answer is incorrect, the user will get a 15 point deduction from their time.

The Final Score is whatever time they have left after they finish the quiz.  If the timer reaches zero, whether through a normal time-out or as a result of getting a question wrong, the score will be 0.

After finishing the quiz, the user can enter their name into the submission form and see if they made the HIGH SCORE list!  ONly the top ten scores will be kept, so good luck!
